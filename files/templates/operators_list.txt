OPERATORS TESTED with Karoo GP v1.4

+,2
-,2
*,2
/,2
**,2

The following must be preceded by another operator due the manner in which Karoo flattens the trees into a 
mathematical expression. Else, Karoo will attempt a function such as (a)sin(b) where sin(b) is correct, but (a)sin 
requires an operator between the operand 'a' and the operator 'sin'. This will be addressed in a future update to Karoo. 

So, each of these must be presented as given in the following example:

+ abs,2
- abs,2
* abs,2
/ abs,2

+ sign,2
- sign,2
* sign,2
/ sign,2

+ square,2
- square,2
* square,2
/ square,2

+ sqrt,2
- sqrt,2
* sqrt,2
/ sqrt,2

+ log,2
- log,2
* log,2
/ log,2


The following operators are not yet functional:

		logical_and     a and b
		logical_or      a or b
		logical_not     not a
		equal           a == b
		not_equal       a != b
		less            a < b
		less_equal      a <= b
		greater         a > b
		greater_equal   a >= 1

		log1p           log1p(a)
		pow             pow(a, b)
