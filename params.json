Karoo GP is a scalable platform with multicore support, designed to readily work with realworld data. <em>No programming required.</em> As a teaching tool, it enables instructors to share step-by-step how an evolutionary algorithm arrives to its solution. As a hands-on learning tool, Karoo GP supports rapid, repeatable experimentation.\r\n\r\nKaroo GP includes a Desktop application with an intuitive user interface, a fully scriptable Server application with user defined default parameters and command-line arguments; a stand-alone Python script which generates randomly constructed subsets of larger datasets and another which normalises datasets; and a toy model which shows the inner workings of multiclass classification.\r\n\r\nThe included <a href=\"http://www.kaistaats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/karoo_gp_quick_start.pdf\">User Guide</a> (PDF) offers system requirements, a crash-course in Genetic Programming, and use of Karoo GP for both the novice and advanced user.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKey functions include:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>written in Object Oriented Python with a hierarchical naming scheme for all methods</li>\r\n\t<li>multi-core support (extensive testing on 24-40 CPUs)</li>\r\n\t<li><em>Desktop</em> application provides a simple user interface with menu, 5 display modes (see below), and runtime reconfiguration of parameters</li>\r\n\t<li><em>Server</em> script provides a configuration file for readily repeated GP runs and command-line arguments</li>\r\n\t<li>anticipates datasets as standard .csv files</li>\r\n\t<li>records the full population of each generation to a .csv file</li>\r\n\t<li>supports customised seed populations</li>\r\n\t<li>supports arithmetic (+, -, *, /, **, sqrt), trigonometric (cos, sin), and boolean (and, or) operators</li>\r\n\t<li>relatively simple framework for preparing custom fitness functions and evaluation routines</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nKaroo GP was developed during Staats' MSc research at the University of Cape Town / African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), South Africa, and owes its foundation to the \"Field Guide to Genetic Programming\" by Poli, Langdon, McPhee, and Koza. The Field Guide and many more GP publications and software packages are showcased at <a href=\"http://geneticprogramming.com/publications/\" target=\"_blank\">www.geneticprogramming.com</a>\r\n\r\nThe full Karoo GP suite will be available by the close of July via <a href=\"https://github.com/kstaats/karoo_gp\" target=\"_blank\">github</a>. <em>Stay tuned!</em>",
