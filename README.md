# Karoo GP

Karoo GP is a evolutionary algorithm, a genetic programming application suite written in Python which provides both 
symbolic regression and classification analysis. Karoo GP is a scalable platform with multicore support, designed to 
readily work with realworld data. No programming required. As a teaching tool, it enables instructors to share 
step-by-step how an evolutionary algorithm arrives to its solution. As a hands-on learning tool, Karoo GP supports 
rapid, repeatable experimentation with a simple interface.

Karoo GP includes an intuitive text-based user interface for desktop applications, a configuration file for readily 
repeated server-side execution, a stand-alone Python script which generates randomly constructed subsets of larger 
datasets, a stand-alone Python script which normalises datasets, and a toy model which shows the inner workings of 
multiclass classification.

The included Quick Start Tutorial (PDF) offers system requirements, a crash-course in Genetic Programming, and use of 
Karoo GP for both the novice and advanced user.

Karoo GP was developed for Kai Staats’ MSc research at the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), Cape Town, South Africa, and 
owes its foundation to the “Field Guide to Genetic Programming” by Poli, Langdon, McPhee, and Koza.
