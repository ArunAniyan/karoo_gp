# Karoo GP

Karoo GP is an evolutionary algorithm, a genetic programming application suite which provides both symbolic regression and classification analysis. Written in the programming language Python, Karoo GP owes its foundation to the “Field Guide to Genetic Programming” by Poli, Langdon, McPhee, and Koza.

Karoo GP provides a transparent interface to the inner workings of genetic programming. As a teaching tool, it enables instructors to showcase, step-by-step, how an evolutionary algorithm arrives to its solution. As a hands-on learning tool, Karoo GP supports rapid, repeatable experimentation with a simple, no-programming-required interface. Included with Karoo GP are two executables: an intuitive Text-based User Interface with built-in, real-world test cases, and a fully scriptable, single-line configuration which provides SciKit Learn-like functionality.

The Quick Start Tutorial (PDF) offers system requirements, a crash-course in Genetic Programming, and use of Karoo GP for both the novice and advanced user.

Feedback is welcomed.

Enjoy!
