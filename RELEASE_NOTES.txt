In karoo_go_server.py

In files/ data_ABS.csv and functions_ABS.csv were rename data_REGRESS.csv and functions_REGRESS.csv accordingly.

2016 07/10-11 - version 0.9.1.4

In karoo_gp_base_class.py
 - renamed variable 'tree_depth_max' to 'tree_depth_base'
 - renamed variable 'tree_depth_adj' to 'tree_depth_max'
 - renamed variable 'gp.pop_tree_depth_max' to 'gp.pop_tree_depth_base'
 - enabled 2 children to be produced by each Crossover function
 - extensive testing of Crossover in debug to validate process
 - reduced # of crossover functions per run by 1/2
 - improved on-screen output for all 4 genetic operators
 - removed not-in-use 'accuracy' test
 - added 'Arguments required:' to each method notes
 - edited a number of method notes
 
In karoo_gp_main.py
 - renamed variables (according to karoo_gp_base_class.py)
 
In karoo_go_server.py
 - renamed variables (according to karoo_gp_base_class.py)



2016 07/08-09 - version 0.9.1.3

In karoo_gp_base_class.py
 - added CTRL-C catch to the (pause) menu; removes potential to accidentally kill a run when attempting to 
   copy/paste an on-screen function to research notes (use the mouse instead).
 - rebuilt each (pause) menu function for improved exception handling
 - added the new gp.tree_depth_adj user defined variable to branch mutation and crossover, enabling Trees to grow 
   beyond their original size which adds opportunity for more complex solutions, as well as the unavoidable bloat
 - reduced complexity of a few lines in both branch mutation and crossover methods
 - tested, tested, tested

In karoo_gp_main.py
 - added CTRL-C catch to the at-launch user menu.
 - renamed the method gp.fx_karoo_crossover_reproduction() to gp.fx_karoo_crossover()
 - added user input for the new global variable gp.tree_depth_adj

In karoo_go_server.py
 - added new gp.tree_depth_adj variable
 
 

2016 07/07 - version 0.9.1.2

In preparation for public launch of Karoo GP, a number of updates are complete or underway.

The Quick Start Tutorial is being fully revised. A number of corrections were made, but more importantly, all new 
content has been added relevant to preparation of datasets and the use of the Karoo GP Tools accordingly. The genetic 
operators descriptions now feature visuals and revised descriptions, as to many other sections.

In the karoo_gp/tools/ directory, all scripts have undergone updates, 2 of which now offer automated scaling and a 
user interface that in the original versions were not present, as follows:

	karoo_data_sort.py (formerly karoo_features_sort.py)
	This script now engages the user with a query for the number of class labels and the number of data points (rows) 
	for the new, randomly generated subset of the parent dataset. This script is designed to be used prior to 
	karoo_normalise.py.

	karoo_normalise.py
	This script now auto-scales to any number of columns and rows (within the limit of your computer's capability), 
	and features a text-based user interface. This script is designed to be used following karoo_data_sort.py.

	karoo_multiclassifier.py
	This script functions as before, but with a minor bug fixed in which the final class was mislabeled.

	karoo_iris_plot.py
	This script functions as before, but with improved in-script documentation and cleaner code.


In development now are a number of updates and improvements to the base_class such that Karoo GP will more readily 
conform to the GP standards, as follows:

1) Karoo GP currently produces only 1 offspring for each parent, where it should produce 2.

2) The tree generation method 'Ramped Half/Half', in its current state, produces a 50/50 split of Full and Grow 
methods, not a graduated ramp through all depths.

3) Karoo GP currently engages a bloat inhibitor, that is, an upper limit on tree depth which is maintained through 
all modes of mutation and crossover. This will become a user defined setting such that it can be adjusted, enabling 
growth of trees beyond the original, user defined limit.

4) Karoo GP will be made to launch as a single, command-line function with all required parameters included, SciKit 
Learn style.



2015 12/23 - version 0.9.1.1

It was discovered that when loading external datasets, Karoo was yet extracting variables (terminals) from the data in 
the files/ directory, according to the selected kernel.

This is fixed.



2015 11/04 - version 0.9.1.0

Initial development of Karoo GP began in February 2015, on a Python-based evolutionary algorithm for an MSc research 
project at the University of Cape Town (UCT) / African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) and the Square 
Kilometer Array (SKA). The myriad debug statements evolved into the user interface while the classic Machine Learning 
test cases became the built-in example runs.

In the course of six months development, the code base grew to become a flexible, easy-to-use platform for Genetic 
Programming.

Karoo GP has been thoroughly tested on a 40-core server at the Square Kilometer Array offices in Cape Town, South 
Africa, where for one month it chewed through 10,000 rows of data for up to 50 hours without incident. It is proved 
as a fully functional, multi-core workhorse.

With all development to date conducted locally, this version 0.9 marks the first release to github.

This initial github release is private, shared with select collaborators only. Please do not distribute any part of 
the code until it is made public.
